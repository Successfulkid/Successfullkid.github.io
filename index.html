        Oxtail (occasionally spelled ox tail or ox-tail) is the culinary name for the tail of cattle. Formerly, it referred only to the tail of a steer. An oxtail typically weighs 7 to 8 lbs. (1â€“1.8 kg) and is skinned and cut into short lengths for sale.<br>

Oxtail is a <em>gelatin-rich meat</em>, which is <strong>usually slow-cooked as a stew or braised</strong>. It is a traditional stock base for a soup. Traditional preparations involve slow cooking, so some modern recipes take a shortcut using a pressure cooker. <em><strong>Oxtail is the main ingredient of the Italian dish coda alla vaccinara (a classic of Roman cuisine)</strong></em>. It is a popular flavour for powdered, instant and premade canned soups in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Oxtails are also one of the popular bases for Russian aspic appetizer dishes, along with pig trotters or ears or cow "knees", but are the preferred ingredients among Russian Jews because they can be kosher.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place oxtail in a shallow dish. Combine Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, salt, sugar, garlic and herb seasoning, browning sauce, paprika, cayenne pepper, and black pepper together in a small bowl. Rub both sides of oxtail with marinade; pour out excess.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Heat vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Sear oxtail in hot oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to a small plate.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Saute carrots, celery, onion, and garlic in the same skillet until softened, about 5 minutes. Add beef broth, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf; bring to a boil. Add oxtail, with its juices, and butter. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until oxtail is fork tender, about 3 hours.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong>Uncover skillet and increase heat to high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce reduces and thickens, about 5 minutes.
